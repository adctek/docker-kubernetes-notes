# Docker Overview

## What is Docker

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in an isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. 

## Containers

A container is a runtime instance of a docker image. A container will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly across development, staging and production.

## Images

Docker images are a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. They are used to create one or more containers.

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. Learn more and find images at https://hub.docker.com
